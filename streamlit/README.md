* The 'abi.json' file that contains the ABI json code obtained from the contract compilation in Remix.

* A '.env' file that contains the Smart Contract Address (obtained after its deployment in Remix), the Web3 Provider URI (Ganache in this use case) and the Company Address (the ETH account address assigned.
