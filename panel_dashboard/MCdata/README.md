# Contents

This folder contains data used to compile and present the Monte Carlo simulations found on the Algorithmic Trading tab

The main folder contents are a set of joblib files that hold a csv file for overall summary statistics from the Monte Carlo simulations as well as a Confidence Interval statement display on the tab.

The mc_ml_predicition_data folder holds the datasets for each portfolio that are used in creating machine learning buy/sell signals for further used in determining portfolio performance in creating the Monte Carlo simulations.

The MCperformance folder holds the files detailing each portfolios performance over time for each investment strategy. These were used in generating the Monte Carlo simulations.
